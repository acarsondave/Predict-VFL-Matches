# Auto Bet Prediction and Booking Bot (VFL)

Hi guys! This is a personal project focused on automating bet predictions and placements for the **Virtual Football League (VFL)**, covering both **VFL4** and **VFL5** matches. The bot uses statistical data and past match outcomes to predict the most likely results, and then automatically places bets on either **Bet9ja** or **Betway** platform.

## Features

The bot is designed to:
- **Predict match outcomes** such as win, draw, or lose, based on statistical trends and past performances (changes after the season).
- **Analyze betting odds** for goals (e.g., over 1.5, over 2.5, under 3.5) to identify the most favorable bets.
- **Occasionally predict correct scores** when patterns in the data strongly indicate a particular outcome (though this is rare due to limited data).

## Contact

If you want to get more information or receive access to the updated version of this bot, just reach out to me at **acarsondev@gmail.com**. I'd be happy to discuss more with you.
